/*! \file CommandTask.h
 * 
 * The command task handles commands.  Commands were used instead of messages so
 * that a call to buffer allocate was not required in an ISR.  Many messages only
 * need type and options to do what they need to.
 *
 * It may be better to create a new type that is passed in the queues. So that 
 * the same queue could handle both a 'message' and a 'command'
 * struct 
 * { 
 *   Length;
 *   MessageType;
 *   Options;
 *   pBuffer;
 * }
 * This will increase the memory footprint of the queues, but speed up overall
 * operation.
